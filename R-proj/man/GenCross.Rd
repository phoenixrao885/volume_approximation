\title{Generator function for cross polytopes}
\usage{
GenCross(dimension, repr)
}
\arguments{
\item{dimension}{The dimension of the cross polytope.}

\item{repr}{A string to declare the representation. It has to be 'H' for H-representation or 'V' for V-representation.}
}
\value{
A cross polytope in H or V-representation. For an H polytope the return value is a list with two elements: the "matrix" containing a \eqn{2^d \times d} matrix \eqn{A} and the "vector" containing a \eqn{2^d} -dimensional vector \eqn{b}, s.t. \eqn{Ax\leq b}. When the V-representation is chosen the return value is a \eqn{2d \times d} matrix that containes the vertices row-wise.
}
\description{
This function can be used to generate a \eqn{d}-dimensional cross polytope in H or V representation.
}
\examples{
# generate a 10-dimensional cross polytope in H-representation
PolyList = GenCross(10, 'H')

# generate a 15-dimension cross polytope in V-representation
PolyList = GenCross(15, 'V')
