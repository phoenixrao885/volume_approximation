\title{Generator function for product of simplices}
\usage{
GenProdSimplex(dimension)
}
\arguments{
\item{dimension}{The dimension of the simplices.}
}
\value{
A polytope defined as the product of two unit simplices in H-representation. The retutn value is a list with two elements: the "matrix" containing a \eqn{(2d+1)\times 2d} matrix \eqn{A} and the "vector" containing a \eqn{(2d+1})-dimensional vector \eqn{b}, s.t. \eqn{Ax\leq b}.
}
\description{
This function can be used to generate a \eqn{2d}-dimensional polytope that is defined as the product of two \eqn{d}-dimensional unit simplices in H-representation.
}
\examples{
# generate a product of two 5-dimensional simplices.
PolyList = GenProdSimplex(5)
}
