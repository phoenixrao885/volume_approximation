Description: Package provides an R interface for volesti C++ package. Volesti computes
             approximations of volume of polytopes given as a set of points or linear inequalities
             or Minkowski sum of segments (zonotopes). There are two algorithms for volume
             approximation as well as algorithms for sampling, rounding and rotating polytopes.
